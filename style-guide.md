It is difficult to write well, and especially challenging to write ideas and instructions in a style that's engaging and respectful.

Here are some tips.


## Tip #1: Avoid command form.  Be alluring instead.

Don't just tell the user what to do.  Especially avoid verbs like "see", "find", "see if you can find", etc.

Examples:

    A set of concrete slides were built near Eureka Valley's
    Seward Park in the 1970s. They're still rideable. Beware
    the nearby witches who harass adult riders.

    In the darkest hours of the night, bike thieves lurk.
    Someone should be out hunting them down and calling the
    cops when they're found.

    A Forgotten Cemetery. There is a gate at the uppermost
    rear portion of the cemetery (the point of highest
    elevation). A trail leads north.  QUIET.  UNUSUAL.  (link)


## Tip #2: Stay relevant and clear

## Tip #3: When appropriate, be mysterious

## Tip #4: Communicate an elicit, shared desire
