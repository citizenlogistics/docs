Note for Guides
===============

## Our mission

(a) to get people doing cooler, more deeply satisfying recreational things, instead of just bars, movies, etc

(b) to create a market and fame for those who know what other people, if they were doing other things, would be more deeply satisfied doing  (that's you)


## How it works

(a) You write a list of things you recommend doing.  Could be places you recommend visiting.  Date ideas.  Missions.  Etc.

(b) Some of them are visible and other missions/ideas (usually a little more advanced or taking more dedication) are HIDDEN and available only to those who've done one of the visible ones.


## How you write it

- see our content guide


## How we pimp it

- We have a proven funnel where we ask people to repost the list in a "Anyone want to do this with me?" facebook or twitter post or email.  It gets your ideas a lot of attention.

- We also have an app that lets hardcore fans engage with and coordinate your ideas without the distraction of facebook, email, the web, etc


## Data you get

- If you like, we'll text or email you whenever someone does your idea or says they enjoyed it.


## How we try to get you paid

- When people like your ideas and/or make plans to do them, we ask them to tip you $2-5 for providing them.

- If your ideas have many fans in a particular city, we can (optionally) encourage them to form a club with paid dues and some organizers with a budget
