Note for Guides
===============

## Our mission

(a) to advance the status quo re: what people do with their free time, towards activities that are more deeply satisfying instead of just bars, movies, etc

(b) to create a large pool of better options, and an easy way to navigate them and to commit to them

(c) to support those who come up with better options  (that's you)


## How it works

(a) You write a list of things you recommend doing.  Could be places you recommend visiting.  Date ideas.  Missions.  Etc.  It gets a snappy title like "YOUR NAME's 6 Ideas for Better Dates"

(b) You *hide* a few of the ideas--usually those that are more advanced or require more dedication.  These will be *unlocked* and available only to those who've already done or planned some of the visible ones.

(c) We push your ideas out, help people share them and organize around them, and let you know which ones people like, who does them, and (optionally) encourage people to send you money when they like your ideas.


## Writing your ideas with style

- see our [style guide for arc ideas](http://prose.io/#citizenlogistics/docs/blob/master/style-guide.md)


## How we'll pimp your ideas

- We have a proven funnel where we ask people to repost the list in a "Anyone want to do this with me?" facebook or twitter post or email.  It gets your ideas a lot of attention and they spread through friend networks.

- We also have an app that lets hardcore fans engage with and coordinate your ideas without the distraction of facebook, email, the web, etc


## Data we can send you

- If you like, we'll text or email you whenever someone does your idea or says they enjoyed it.


## How we'll try to get you paid

- When people like your ideas and/or make plans to do them, we ask them to tip you $2-5 for providing them.

- If your ideas have many fans in a particular city, we can (optionally) encourage them to form a club with paid dues, a budget, and some organizers
